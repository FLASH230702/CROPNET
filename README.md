Cropnet is a crop recommendation system that suggests the best crop to be grown in a particular area. This system takes into account various factors such as soil type, weather conditions, and water availability to determine the optimal crop to be grown. The aim of this project is to help farmers increase their crop yield and optimize the use of their resources.
